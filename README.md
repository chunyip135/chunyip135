 I am Samuel wong. I'm a freelance Data Scientist. I'm currently a student major in Actuarial Science ( Year 2 ) at Heriot-Watt University Malaysia. I'm passionate with Statistics and Machine Learning. 
 
 Feel free to leave a message to me. 
 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal website using Hugo and hosted on github pages.
  * Why Hugo?
    * Because hugo provides well-structured and degsign themes to start with. You just have to edits and tweaks some of the settings based on your preferences.
    * All of the sites, posts are in .md file (readme) and should be familiar by developer that uses jupyter notebooks most of the time.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning using tensorflow (Image classification).
  * How do I learn?
    1. Tensorflow in practice specialization on Coursera
    2. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras & Tensorflow book
    
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking freelance jobs on Fiverr & Upwork.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Data Science, Maths, Python, Machine Learning and also Deep Learning.
